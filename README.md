# Applying-Stokes-Theorem

As part of my multi-variable calculus course, I solved a problem and demonstrated my steps using LaTeX &amp; Overleaf!

## Getting Started

1. Go to Overleaf and log in to your account.
2. Create a new blank project or open an existing project where you want to pull the Applying Stokes repository.
3. In your Overleaf project, navigate to the left sidebar and click on the "Git" button.
4. In the Git menu, click on the "Pull from GitHub" option.
5. Copy the following command to clone the repository:
   
`git clone https://github.com/LydiaAlem/Applying-Stokes-Theorem.git`

6. Open your preferred terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to save the clone.
7. Paste the copied command into the terminal and press Enter to execute it. This will clone the Applying Stokes repository to your local machine.
8. Once the cloning process is complete, go back to Overleaf and click on "Upload Project" in the left sidebar.
9. Choose the option to upload a ZIP file.
10. Locate the cloned folder on your local machine and compress it into a ZIP file.
11. Upload the ZIP file to Overleaf.
12. Overleaf will extract the contents of the ZIP file and create a project with the Applying Stokes repository.
